PDF documents
-------------
Though still under development, pyFormex is already being used as a
valuable and indispensable tool in several research projects. To give
you an idea of what it can be used for, here are some links to past
research using pyFormex.

- `Bifurcation stenting`_: Analysis of side branch access during bifurcation stenting.
- `FE modeling of stents`_: Finite element analysis of bifurcation stenting.


Videos
------
Some users have created a video of their work with pyFormex and made
it available on YouTube:

- `pyFormex GUI`_: Illustrating some aspects of the pyFormex GUI.
- `Bifurcation meshing`_: Hexahedral meshing of a carotid
  bifurcation. By Gianluca.
- `Image projection`_: Projection  of a 2-D image on a 3-D surface. By Gianluca.
