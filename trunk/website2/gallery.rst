-------

This gallery is a collection of screenshots, illustrated examples,
videos and PDF documents of pyFormex setup and use in education and
research.

These documents have been collected over the past years of pyFormex
development and do not necessarily correspond to the latest version.
They may hoever still give you a good (though limited) impression of
what pyFormex can do for you.
