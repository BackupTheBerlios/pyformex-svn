Support
=======


`Support tracker`_
------------------
If you need help with the installation or use of pyFormex, or if you want to
discuss existing features or request new ones, the best way is to use the
pyFormex `Support tracker`_.


`Bug tracker`_
--------------
If you run into a problem that looks like a
malfunction or a bug in pyFormex, you can report it on the `Bug tracker`_.
  
User meeting
------------ 
A number of pyFormex users and developers at `IBiTech-biommeda`_ have taken the initiative to gather at regular intervals to discuss the use and future development of pyFormex. 

These meetings are held approximately monthly at the `IBiTech, Ghent University`_ institute and are announced approximately one week by
advance on this website. All pyFormex users are welcome.
The minutes of the previous meetings are available from our `FTP Site`_.

Professional support
--------------------
Or you can hire professional support from a young startup company: `FEops`_. They provide professional engineering services using pyFormex (e.g. creating customized pyFormex scripts and/or models) and also offer training and support for pyFormex.
