#
# pyformex is a program that lets you easily generate large sets of coordinates
# following simple generation patterns such as translation, rotation,
# reflection, mathematical functions, replication.
# It may be useful to generate node and elements sets in finite element mesh
# generation and in the design of spatial frame structures.
#
# But if you find it useful for something else, please go ahead.
# If you have questions or remarks, feel free to contact the author.
#
# BEWARE: this is very early beta beta software, undergoing frequent changes!

Howto install:
-------------
<TODO>

Howto remove:
------------
<TODO

What you need:
--------------
python: www.python.org
  We recommend version 2.2 or higher
numarray: http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray
  We recommend version 0.8 or higher
<TODO>


Why:
---
<TODO>

Why Python:
----------
Because it is simply the quickest to learn and most powerful scripting language I know (and that I like to program with). More on www.python.org


ToDo:
----
A LOT!

But this is a list of things we have to do before we go public:

- introduce all (or most) of the formian functions
- provide basic documentation
- make a clean GUI
- provide output facilities (text and graphics)
- make a formian to pyformex translator

And these ideas might be useful:
- on installation, create a remove script





Documentation:
-------------
Because it is not obvious from the GUI:

The canvas showing the Formex has dynamic zoom/pan/rotate functionality.
Moving the mouse with one of the buttons depressed will activate this:
  LEFT mouse button : rotate
  MIDDLE mouse button : pan
  RIGHT mouse button : zoom : horizontal movement zooms by camera lens angle,
        vertical movement zooms by changing camera distance. The first mode 
	keeps the perspecive, the second one changes it.
	Moving right and up zooms in, left and down zooms out. Moving 
	diagonally from upper left to lower right more or less keeps the
	image size, while changing the perspective.
